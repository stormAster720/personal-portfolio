            and I am a 19 years old teenager born (and currently living in) Colombia who's passionate for learning modern technologies 
            either for making games or for doing websites. I am a self taught game developer
            who has been learning
            this subject since I was 13 years old, and currently I am on my way to become a full stack web developer!

        I started my journey back in 2015 when I was still at school. It all started when I had to do a school research
        project
        related to any tech subject in which I decided to pick videogames. Since I had to also show a working example of
        what I learnt
        through the research time, I decided to start learning how to do very simple games using Unity3D.</p>

      <p>
        At that time, it was a very difficult task for me, because I was living on an area where there was hardly ever good enough
        network to either download a software or open youtube videos, it would generally take a couple of minutes to do such things or the internet
        would completly disconnect
        (also the fact that I had a very old and fauly laptop which would suddenly turn off due to overheating and was also very limited in storage).
        Eventually I was able to over come those problems and started to develop my project which was essentially a package created by someone else but it 
        was heavily modified according to my needs. I was able to present my project in time while also achieving a good grade.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fast forward to 2017, I was already able to code on my own without reading blogs or watching videos (at this point, I already had a more
        suitable laptop for what I was doing) and I also had a bit of a reputation because of a project I was doing at a time (a Halo fangame which
         I eventually remastered but then stoped working on it as I moved it to Unreal Engine).
      </p>

      <p> 
        With lots of practise, I eventually managed to become a sort of generalist in the use of Unity, I learnt things like shaders, lighting, coding patterns and even rising technologies such as C# Jobs as well as
        ECS. Later on, I decided to go ahead and try some other technologies related to my niche such as Blender and 
        Unreal Engine; the learning curve for those were very smooth, as those to programs shared very similar concepts to what I learnt using Unity.

        Coming to the present, for the past few seven months, I decided to put game development to a side for a while so I could find some other interest
        on another niche, so that's when I got into the world of web development. I started as a self taught web developer as a freelancer using WIX for doing customized user experience
        (use javascript to customize an already built in feature into wix) and then eventually moved to more advanced programs to do the same thing while also
        learning css and html. It wasn't until a month ago where I decided to buy a one year course for becoming a full stack web devloper as now days some companies 
        out there prefer somebody with a proof of expertise rather than self taught people.

      <p>Since I was a child, I always loved all stuff related to technology, let it be computer related, or industry related, 
        I have always been in love with all of that topic, so as a Hobby (when I was probably around 14 or 15 years old) I learnt quite
        few things related to robotics such as arduino and electronic components where I made my own projects; They were not a big deal
        but back in the day, when I was at highschool, it helped me a lot on robotics lecture and it also allowed me to participate in science events
        related to robotics. 

        I graduated from highschool in 2019, and since then I attended 2 universities, which I droped off, the reason behind that was, 1, during the 
        pandimic it became nearly imposible to learn from remote, as nor the university and students were prepared for that, and as the second university,
        the carreer turned out to not be what it said it was; It was a career related to animation and videogames, however, your ending bachelor degree would 
        be conceptual artist, which made no sense at all and also the career expected you to have from medium to advanced knowledge in drawing, which I did not
        have at all.
